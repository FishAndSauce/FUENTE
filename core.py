# get raw data
# get demand data
# get generator and storage characteristics/cost data
# get resource data (e.g. biofuel, gas, coal costs)

# Create LDC and effective LDC after intermittent RE capacity scenarios
# generate real LDC
# generate RE capacity scenarios
# generate effective LDCs for each scenario

# cost curves
# determine cost curve line equations (y = mx+b)


# calculate cost curve intesections
# caclulate lowest envelope


### LDC and capacity
# intersection of CF and LDC
# calculation of areas under LDC
# calculation of tot cost and emissions

###
# dump outputs
# pretty graphs of outputs
